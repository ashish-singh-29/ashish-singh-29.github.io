               <p>
                What is it that you want to achieve in life?</p>
                
               <p>I'm sure you have a list of things that you want to accomplish. And till now you would have had this question answered a million of times in your head.
                  But, if you are not aware of the fact that there is no such thing as a perfect answer, then you should ask yourself these questions: What do I really want to achieve in life? How can I make my life better for me and others?</p>

               <p>But the problem appears not when you have a bunch of ideas in your mind, but when you actually start doing them.
                 Because then you need to take decisions and make them based on your own experience.
                 So, let us see how we can use our data to make our life better. First, let's look at the definition of data-driven decision-making: data-driven decision-making is the process of collecting information from sources outside your control.</p>

               <p>The goal of this process is to find out what are the most important things that matter in your life and to make those things more relevant.
                   It is also about finding out what is the best way of doing a particular thing for example, if you want to buy a new car or go on vacation with your family, you need to know what kind of car would fit your budget and if you can take a vacation right now.
                   The more clarity you have in relation to your end goal or objective, the more focused and rewarding your analysis will be.</p>
               
               <p><img src="images/work_8.jpg" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></p>

               <p>Now, what is analysis? An attempt to understand how something works or why something does what it does.
                 When I wanted to study further in my career, I was looking at the definition of analytical thinking.
                 Because I was also interested in the concept of decision making and being able to think critically about a problem and come up with solutions that are both practical and useful.
                 So, I choose my bachelors of business administration but the con about my bachelor's is that I don't get to practice on real problems.</p>
          
               <p>And I started searching online for information on how to learn more and get skilled.
                  I stumbled around on this course google offered for the beginners and I instantly applied for it.
                  And got accepted for financial aid and now 4 months and 2 weeks after completing my specialization which consisted 8 courses revolving around the process of data analytics.</p>
               <p>I got a push start and now here I am working developing skills I started learning about 4 months ago just by signing up for a course of specialization which was so extremely help and I cannot express enough that those courses are in an order for not just getting you started into this field but actually getting you ready for this field.</p>
               <p>The Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate is worth it, especially for data analytics beginners.
                  For anyone who feels this field is for them I guarantee them the start is just on sign-up away and itâ€™s Google Data-Analytics Professional Certification which can get you through the roughly patched idea of how a day of work in data analyst looks like?</p>
